    <p><b>Applications of voltmeter</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Compressor Performance:</b> The voltmeter can measure the voltage across the
      compressor terminals to assess its electrical input and performance.
      Fluctuations or deviations from expected voltage levels may indicate issues
      with the compressor motor or electrical connections.<br><br>
      <b>2. Condenser and Evaporator Fans:</b> Voltmeter readings across the fan motors
      can help evaluate their electrical input and performance. Consistent voltage
      levels indicate proper functioning, while deviations may suggest motor or
      electrical problems.<br><br>
      <b>3. Thermostatic Control:</b> Voltmeter measurements across the thermostat can
      verify if it's receiving the correct voltage signals for controlling the system's
      operation. This helps ensure the system maintains the desired temperature
      levels effectively.<br><br>
      <b>4. Electrical Safety:</b> Monitoring voltage levels throughout the system with a
      voltmeter helps ensure that electrical components are operating within safe
      parameters, reducing the risk of electrical hazards such as overloading or short
      circuits.<br><br>
      <b>5. Troubleshooting:</b> When issues arise in the refrigeration system, voltage
      measurements can help identify the source of the problem. By comparing
      expected voltage levels to actual readings, technicians can pinpoint electrical
      faults and implement appropriate repairs or adjustments.<br><br>
    <p><br>
      <br>
    <p><b>Advantages of Voltmeter</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Diagnosis of Electrical Issues:</b> Voltmeters help pinpoint electrical problems
      such as voltage drops, irregularities, or fluctuations within the system, enabling
      timely diagnosis and troubleshooting.
      <br><br>
      <b>2. Performance Evaluation:</b> By measuring voltage levels across various
      components, voltmeters allow for the assessment of electrical performance,
      ensuring that components like compressors and fans are operating within their
      specified voltage ranges.
      <br><br>
      <b>3. Efficiency Monitoring:</b> Monitoring voltage levels with a voltmeter aid in
      evaluating the energy efficiency of the system. Consistent voltage readings
      indicate proper energy consumption, while deviations may signal
      inefficiencies or malfunctions.
      <br><br>
      <b>4. Safety Assurance:</b> Voltmeters help ensure the safety of the refrigeration
      system by detecting any electrical abnormalities that could lead to hazards such
      as electrical fires or shocks. Early identification of such issues allows for
      preventive maintenance or repairs.
      <br><br>
      <b>5. Data Collection:</b> Voltmeter readings provide valuable data for analysing the
      electrical behaviour of the refrigeration system over time. This data can be used
      for performance optimization, trend analysis, and predictive maintenance.
      <br><br>
      <b>6. Educational Purposes:</b> In laboratory or educational settings, voltmeters offer
      hands-on experience with electrical measurements, helping students
      understand the principles of electricity and its application in refrigeration
      systems.
      <br><br>
      <b>7. Cost Savings:</b> By facilitating proactive maintenance and early detection of
      electrical faults, voltmeters help prevent costly breakdowns and prolong the
      lifespan of refrigeration system components.
