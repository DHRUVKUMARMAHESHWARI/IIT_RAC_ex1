                <p>The refrigerator compressor is one of the four main components located inside your fridge that makes
                    your refrigeration system work. The compressor works directly with the condenser and evaporator
                    coil, along with the expansion valve. Your refrigerator's compressor controls and compresses the
                    flow of liquid refrigerant, playing a crucial role in your refrigeration system. </p>
                <p>Compressors fundamentally work the same for air conditioning systems, but will differ in some big
                    ways, and this article focuses on how a refrigerator compressor works.</p>
                <p>The primary objective of a compressor is to increase the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume.
                    This process is essential in various industries and applications where compressed gases are required
                    for powering machinery, pneumatic tools, HVAC systems, refrigeration, and numerous other processes.
                </p>
                <p>The reciprocating compressors have the same design as that of a combustion engine. The individual
                    cylinders of the same will contain two to six pistons. All these pistons have a central crankshaft.
                    The piston will move downward, and the refrigerant will be sucked inside the cylinder via an inlet
                    valve. </p>
                <p>The inlet valve will close when the piston moves back in the upward direction. The volume of the
                    space within the cylinder will also decrease, thereby compressing the refrigerant. After a certain
                    point of time, the refrigerant will become compressed. It will need a sufficient amount of force to
                    open the discharge valve. The refrigerant will exit and promote the cycle to be repeated.</p>

                <p>In refrigeration, an evaporator is the heat exchanger where the refrigerant circulating inside the
                    refrigeration circuit absorbs the thermal energy from the environment, which is then cooled. This is
                    how the state of the refrigerant changes from liquid to vapour, giving it its name. As a result, the
                    refrigerant evaporates to absorb the temperature or energy from the environment to be cooled.
                <p>The main objective of an evaporator in a refrigeration system is to absorb heat from the
                    surroundings, such as the air or water being cooled, and transfer it to the refrigerant, causing it
                    to evaporate. This process cools the surroundings while allowing the refrigerant to become a gas,
                    which is then compressed to begin the cycle again.</p>

                    1. Initially, high-temperature vaporised gas is introduced through a vapour inlet,
                    while coolant is introduced into the condenser shell through the coolant inlet.<br>
                    2. As the high-temperature vapour traverses the tubes within the shell, it
                    undergoes a heat transfer process, releasing its heat to the surrounding coolant.<br>
                    3. This heat exchange rapidly reduces the vapour's temperature along its path,
                    causing it to transition from a vapour state to a liquid state.<br>
                    4. When the vapour temperature aligns with that of the coolant,
                    the condensation process concludes.<br>
                    5. At this stage, the vapour is fully condensed, transformed into a liquid state, and
                    ready for use as feedwater, accessible through the condensate outlet.<br>

                    Mechanical pressure gauges utilise an inner tube that is connected to a gear and

                    the tube surges, the tube uncoils slightly. As the tube uncoils, the motion
                    triggers the gear and shaft system that moves the pointer on the gauge. The
                    amount of uncoiling movement that occurs is relative to the pressure within the
                    tube. This movement then informs the pointer, giving you a pressure reading.

                <p>The objective of a rotameter is to measure the flow rate of a fluid in a pipeline. It typically
                    consists of a tapered tube with a float inside that rises as the flow increases. The position of the
                    float within the tube indicates the flow rate, making it a simple and reliable device for measuring

                    The operation of a rotameter is based on the variable area principle. That is,
                    the flow of a liquid raises the float inside a tapered tube, increasing the area
                    through which the liquid can pass. The larger the flow, the higher the float
                    will be raised. The level of the float is directly proportional to the flowrate of
                    the liquid, and it moves up or down in proportion to the liquid’s flowrate and
                    the annular area around the float. The tapered tube allows the annular area
                    between the ball and the tube to be proportionate to the flow, in a balanced
                    condition.<br>

                    refrigerant to expand rapidly as it enters the evaporator. This expansion leads
                    to a decrease in temperature, enabling the refrigerant to absorb heat from the
                    surroundings inside the evaporator, thus cooling the space or object being

                <p>An ammeter is an instrument used to measure electric current in a circuit. It is typically connected
                    in series with
                    the circuit under test so that the current flows through the meter. Ammeters are designed to have
                    very low
                    resistance so as not to significantly affect the circuit being measured. </p><br>

                <p><b>Working of Ammeter</b><br>
                    The working principle of an ammeter in a vapor compression system involves
                    measuring the electrical current flowing through the compressor motor.<br><br>
                    1. <b>Installation:</b> The ammeter is connected in series with the electrical circuit that
                    powers the compressor motor. This means that the current flowing through the
                    compressor motor also flows through the ammeter.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. <b>Current Measurement:</b> As the compressor motor operates, it draws electrical
                    current from the power supply to power its operation. The ammeter measures
                    this current by detecting the magnetic field generated by the flow of current
                    through its internal components.<br><br>
                    3. <b>Display:</b> The ammeter displays the measured current either on an analog scale
                    or digitally, depending on the type of ammeter being used. The reading
                    indicates the amount of electrical current flowing through the compressor
                    motor at any given time.<br><br>
                    4. <b>Monitoring and Analysis:</b> Technicians or operators monitor the ammeter
                    readings to ensure that the compressor motor is operating within its normal
                    operating range. Abnormalities in the current reading, such as sudden spikes
                    or drops, can indicate potential issues with the compressor motor, electrical
                    connections, or other components in the system.<br>
