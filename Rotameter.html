            <p><b>Applications of rotameter</b>
            <br>
            <br>
Accurate density rotameters are also used for effective measurement.
Furnaces and gas burners in industrial sites need to be controlled not to
damage equipment; therefore, rotameters are used for monitoring. This
equipment is also used in industries for refrigeration flow control. </p>

            <p><b>Advantages of rotameter</b>
            <br>
            <br>
Rotameters are uncomplicated devices made with inexpensive materials,
which makes them cost-effective.
<br><br>
1. Rotameters can be installed into areas that don’t have power because they
operate only on the properties of the liquid and gravity itself.
<br><br>
2. Rotameters can easily be installed to existing piping systems with standard
fittings or via a panel.
<br><br>
3. A rotameter’s scale for measuring is linear because the flowrate is based on
area variation. That means that you can count on accurate readings throughout
the complete range.
<br><br>
4. With a properly maintained rotameter you can expect sustained high
repeatability.
<br><br>
5. Smaller rotameters typically only have a few inches of water column pressure
drop. That means that rotameters can be installed nearly anywhere in the
process. Smaller pressure drops mean smaller pumps, which can mean lower
pumping costs.</p>
